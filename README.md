# module2_final_project
We propose to assist music producers with their search for music production opportunities. Our slices of analysis focus on four hypothesis test questions:  

**(1)** Is there a statistical difference between the ratings of two different music genres: Jazz and Metal?  
**(2)** Will the label with the most artists have higher scores than the label with  the least artists signed?  
**(3)** Is there a relationship between labelsâ€™ scores and the genres they produce?  
**(4)** Have average song ratings changed from 2000-2009 to 2010-2017?  

Our methodology consists of approaching each of these questions with a null hypothesis to reject. Our null hypotheses for each question are as follows:  

**(1)** Songs of the Jazz Genre will not have a different rating allocation from Metal.  
**(2)** The label with the most artists will not have significantly different scores than the label with  the least artists signed.  
**(3)** The label with the most genre diversity will not have higher scores than the label with least genre diversity.  
**(4)** Average song ratings have stayed the same between time periods 2000-2009 and 2010-2017.
