# module2_final_project
We propose to assist music producers with their search for music production opportunities. Our slices of analysis focus on four hypothesis test questions: 
* (1) Is there a statistical difference between the ratings of two different music genres: Jazz and Metal? 
* (2) Will the label with the most artists have higher scores than the label with  the least artists signed? 
* (3) Is there a relationship between labelsâ€™ scores and the genres they produce? 
* (4) Have average song ratings changed from 2000-2009 to 2010-2017?
