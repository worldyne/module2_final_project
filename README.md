# Module 2 Final Project: 
## Music Industry Analysis for Producers
We propose to assist music producers with their search for music production opportunities. Our slices of analysis focus on four hypothesis test questions:  

**(1)** Is there a statistical difference between the ratings of two different music genres: Jazz and Metal?  
**(2)** Will the label with the most artists have higher scores than the label with  the least artists signed?  
**(3)** Is there a relationship between labelsâ€™ scores and the genres they produce?  
**(4)** Have average song ratings changed from 2000-2009 to 2010-2017?  

Our methodology consists of approaching each of these questions with a null hypothesis to reject and an alternative hypothesis to accept in the case of rejection. Our hypotheses for each question are as follows:  

**(1)**
* H<sub>0</sub>: Songs of the Jazz genre will not have a different rating allocation from Metal.  
* H<sub>a</sub>:  
**(2)**
* H<sub>0</sub>: The label with the most artists will not have significantly different scores than the label with the least artists signed.  
* H<sub>a</sub>: The label with the most artists will have significantly different scores than the label with the least artists signed.  
**(3)**
* H<sub>0</sub>: The label with the most genre diversity will not have higher scores than the label with least genre diversity.  
* H<sub>a</sub>: The label with the most genre diversity will have higher scores than the label with the least genre diversity.  
**(4)**
* H<sub>0</sub>: Average song ratings have stayed the same between time periods 2000-2009 and 2010-2017.  
* H<sub>a</sub>:  

During our statistical analysis, we found the following results:

**(1)**  
**(2)** The label with the most artists signed does not perform significantly differently than labels with only one artist signed. With a significance level of 0.05, and a p-value of 0.706, we fail to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  
**(3)** The labels with the most genre diversity does have statistically significantly higher scores than the labels with the least genre diversity. With a significance level of 0.05, and a p-value of 0.015 we successfully reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  
**(4)**
